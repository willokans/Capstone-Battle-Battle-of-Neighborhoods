The problems with these sites is that they are one dimensional. If you want to find out all this information about a city you plan to visit next month, you have to do the hard work. Also, just because a venue is the hottest place to go for a night out does not always mean that the unwitting tourist should just ramble in unprepared. The areas surrounding this new venue might be riddled with crime including muggings, car theft and assault, for example. Approach the venue from any direction other than from the north and you could be putting your life in danger. This is when my idea comes in."
